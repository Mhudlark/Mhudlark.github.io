			`The title says it all. I'm a developer, I love dogs, and I wear tracksuits.`,
			`As a developer I've worked with a variety of languages and frameworks, but

			My love of organisation extends into my work as I'm a big fan of clean and
			well structured code.`,
			`When I need a break I love to go outside for walks and to play sport. I'm 
			always keen for a kick of the footy, a hit of squash or a quick bouldering
			session.`,
